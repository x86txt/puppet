## Overview
This is a [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) module. It
installs oh-my-zsh for a user and can change their shell to zsh. It can install
and configure themes and plugins for users.

## Module Description
oh-my-zsh is a community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.
See [https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
for more details.

## Setup
In order to install `rehan-ohmyzsh`, run the following command:
```bash
$ puppet module install rehan-ohmyzsh
```
The module does expect all the data to be provided through 'Hiera'. See [Usage](#usage) for examples on how to configure it.

#### Requirements
This module is designed to be as clean and compliant with latest puppet code guidelines. It works with:

  - `puppet >=5.5.10`

## Usage

```puppet
# for a single user
ohmyzsh::install { 'user1': }

# for multiple users in one shot and set their shell to zsh
ohmyzsh::install { ['root', 'user1']: set_sh => true }

# install and disable prompt for automatic updates
ohmyzsh::install { 'user2': disable_auto_update => true }

# install a theme for a user
ohmyzsh::fetch::theme { 'root': url => 'http://zanloy.com/files/dotfiles/oh-my-zsh/squared.zsh-theme' }

# set a theme for a user
ohmyzsh::theme { ['root', 'user1']: } # would install 'clean' theme as default

ohmyzsh::theme { ['root', 'user1']: theme => 'robbyrussell' } # specific theme

# activate plugins for a user
ohmyzsh::plugins { 'user1': plugins => ['git', 'github'] }
```
